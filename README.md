# CV Application

[Check out this project here](https://tidalsana.github.io/cv-application/)

## Summary

This project was built for The Odin Project curriculum. Here we are assigned to create some sort of template generator for a CV or Resume.
Sounds simple...right? Well at this point I was tasked with creating my first React Application (wooo!), it was honestly a little difficult
to get used to, but it went pretty swell towards the end of it. Of course we still compile most of the things we learned like DOM manipulation,
but we delved deep into the nuances of componenets, handlers, lists and states. 

## Things learned

I am very sure if I started react without going back to JavaScript and refining my skills in it, this would've been very difficult to understand.
Like I said earlier, the project was pretty much just adding things (forms, inputs, and divs) to the root div, but it was pretty difficult to
conceptualize in the beginning. I feel good now, but I know there is much to learn after this.
